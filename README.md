### Hi ðŸ‘‹  I'm Ben Spotswood

Full-stack Software Developer experienced in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript-based programming with a background in data analysis. I'm interested in building projects in React, Ruby, Rails, and R. In my downtime, I enjoy creating baseball analytics projects, learning Jiu Jitsu, playing music, and sourdough baking. 

Feel free to reach out, and be sure to check out my blog to see what I'm working on.
